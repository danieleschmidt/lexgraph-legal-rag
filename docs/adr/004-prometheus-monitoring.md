# ADR-004: Prometheus Monitoring Stack

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Author**: Development Team  

## Context

The LexGraph Legal RAG system requires comprehensive monitoring and observability to ensure production reliability, performance optimization, and proactive issue detection. The monitoring solution needs to:

- Collect application metrics (request latency, error rates, throughput)
- Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Provide alerting for critical issues and SLA violations
- Support custom business metrics (search accuracy, citation quality)
- Integrate with Kubernetes deployment environment
- Enable historical analysis and capacity planning

Monitoring solutions evaluated:
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Industry-standard observability stack with rich ecosystem
- **DataDog**: Comprehensive SaaS monitoring platform, but introduces vendor lock-in
- **New Relic**: APM-focused solution, but costly for infrastructure monitoring
- **ELK Stack**: Primarily logging-focused, less suitable for metrics collection

## Decision

We will use Prometheus for metrics collection with Grafana for visualization because:

1. **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted in Kubernetes environments
2. **Pull-based Model**: Resilient to network issues and service discovery
3. **Rich Ecosystem**: Extensive library of exporters and integrations
4. **Cost Effective**: Open-source with no licensing fees
5. **Kubernetes Native**: Excellent integration with K8s service discovery
6. **Query Language**: PromQL enables complex metric analysis and alerting

## Implementation Details

### Metrics Architecture
```yaml
Prometheus Server
├── Application Metrics (FastAPI, agents)
├── System Metrics (node-exporter)
├── Kubernetes Metrics (kube-state-metrics)
└── Custom Business Metrics (search quality)
```

### Key Metrics Collected

#### Application Metrics
- `http_requests_total`: Request counter by endpoint and status
- `http_request_duration_seconds`: Request latency histogram
- `search_operations_total`: Search operation counter
- `vector_index_size`: Vector index size and status
- `agent_execution_duration`: Multi-agent operation timing

#### System Metrics
- CPU utilization and load average
- Memory usage and availability
- Disk I/O and space utilization
- Network traffic and error rates

#### Business Metrics
- Search result relevance scores
- Citation accuracy metrics
- User session duration
- Document indexing performance

### Integration Points
- `metrics.py`: Prometheus client integration with custom metrics
- `monitoring.py`: Health checks and system status monitoring
- `observability.py`: Structured logging with metric correlation
- Kubernetes ServiceMonitor for automatic target discovery

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# Critical alerts
- API error rate > 5%
- Response time p95 > 2 seconds
- Memory usage > 90%
- Disk space < 10%

# Warning alerts  
- Search accuracy < 95%
- Index build failures
- High CPU utilization
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Comprehensive Visibility**: Full-stack monitoring from application to infrastructure
- **Proactive Alerting**: Early detection of performance degradation and failures
- **Historical Analysis**: Long-term trend analysis for capacity planning
- **Cost Effective**: No vendor licensing fees or data ingestion costs
- **Kubernetes Integration**: Native service discovery and auto-scaling integration
- **Community Ecosystem**: Rich library of dashboards and exporters

### Negative
- **Storage Requirements**: Long-term metric storage requires significant disk space
- **Configuration Complexity**: Requires expertise in PromQL and alerting rules
- **High Availability**: Need to setup Prometheus clustering for production
- **Data Retention**: Need to configure appropriate retention policies

### Mitigation Strategies
- Automated Prometheus configuration management with GitOps
- Pre-built Grafana dashboards for common monitoring patterns
- Comprehensive documentation for PromQL queries and alerting rules
- Regular backup and disaster recovery procedures for metric data

## Grafana Integration

### Dashboard Strategy
- **System Overview**: High-level health and performance metrics
- **Application Performance**: API latency, error rates, throughput
- **Search Analytics**: Query patterns, result quality, user behavior
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster health and resource utilization

### Alerting Integration
- Grafana Alerting for complex multi-condition rules
- Integration with PagerDuty/Slack for incident notification
- Alert escalation policies based on severity levels

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Role-based access control for Grafana dashboards
- API key authentication for Prometheus queries
- Network policies restricting metric endpoint access

### Data Protection
- No sensitive data in metric labels or annotations
- Secure transport (TLS) for metric collection
- Regular security updates for Prometheus/Grafana components

## Performance Characteristics

### Metric Cardinality
- Limit high-cardinality labels to prevent memory issues
- Regular cardinality monitoring and cleanup
- Use recording rules for expensive queries

### Storage Optimization
- 15-day retention for high-resolution metrics
- 1-year retention for downsampled metrics
- Compression and efficient storage formats
