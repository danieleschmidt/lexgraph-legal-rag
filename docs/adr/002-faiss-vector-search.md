# ADR-002: FAISS for Vector Search

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-08-02  
**Author**: Development Team  

## Context

The LexGraph Legal RAG system requires efficient vector similarity search across large legal document corpora. The system needs to:

- Handle 10,000+ legal documents with sub-second query response times
- Support semantic search with high-dimensional embeddings (768+ dimensions)
- Scale horizontally for production workloads
- Provide exact and approximate nearest neighbor search capabilities
- Integrate seamlessly with Python-based backend architecture

Alternative solutions considered:
- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database, but introduces external dependency and cost
- **Chroma**: Simple embedding database, but limited scalability for large corpora
- **Weaviate**: Feature-rich vector database, but adds complexity for our use case
- **FAISS**: Facebook's library for efficient similarity search, optimized for performance

## Decision

We will use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) as our primary vector search engine because:

1. **Performance**: Highly optimized C++ implementation with Python bindings
2. **Scalability**: Supports indices up to billions of vectors
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple index types (IVF, HNSW, LSH) for different use cases
4. **Cost**: Open-source with no licensing fees or external service dependencies
5. **Control**: Full control over index management and deployment
6. **Memory Efficiency**: Supports both in-memory and disk-based indices

## Implementation Details

### Index Strategy
- **Primary Index**: FAISS IVFFlat for exact search with reasonable performance
- **Fallback Index**: FAISS HNSW for approximate search when speed is critical
- **Hybrid Approach**: Semantic search with FAISS + traditional text search for comprehensive results

### Storage Pattern
- Vector indices stored as `.faiss` files alongside document metadata
- Semantic indices stored with `.sem` suffix for differentiation
- Automatic index loading and fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable

### Integration Points
- `faiss_index.py`: Core FAISS wrapper with search and indexing methods
- `semantic_search.py`: Higher-level search abstraction
- `document_pipeline.py`: Index creation during document ingestion

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance**: Sub-second search across large document collections
- **Cost Effective**: No external service fees or API rate limits
- **Flexibility**: Can optimize index types based on specific use case requirements
- **Scalability**: Proven to handle billion-scale vector collections
- **Local Control**: Full control over data locality and privacy

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Requires understanding of different index types and parameters
- **Memory Usage**: Large indices require significant RAM allocation
- **GPU Dependency**: Optimal performance requires GPU resources
- **Maintenance**: Need to manage index updates and consistency manually

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive documentation of index configuration options
- Automated index rebuilding and validation processes
- Fallback to CPU-based search when GPU unavailable
- Monitoring and alerting for index performance and memory usage
