# ADR-001: Multi-Agent Architecture with LangGraph

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The LexGraph Legal RAG system requires intelligent routing and processing of legal queries across multiple specialized functions (retrieval, summarization, citation). Traditional monolithic approaches lack the flexibility and composability needed for complex legal reasoning workflows.

## Decision
We will implement a multi-agent architecture using LangGraph as the orchestration framework. The system will consist of:

1. **Router Agent**: Determines which specialized agents to invoke based on query type
2. **Retriever Agent**: Handles semantic search across legal document indices
3. **Summarizer Agent**: Synthesizes retrieved information into coherent responses
4. **Citation Agent**: Generates precise clause-level citations and references

## Rationale
- **Modularity**: Each agent has a single responsibility, enabling independent development and testing
- **Flexibility**: New agents can be added without modifying existing components
- **Composability**: Complex workflows can be built by combining simple agent interactions
- **Debugging**: Agent-level logging and metrics provide visibility into system behavior
- **Scalability**: Individual agents can be scaled independently based on load patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns between different system functions
- Easier to test individual components in isolation
- Better observability through agent-level metrics and tracing
- Simplified debugging of complex legal reasoning workflows
- Ability to optimize each agent for its specific task

### Negative
- Increased complexity in agent coordination and error handling
- Potential latency overhead from agent-to-agent communication
- Need for sophisticated monitoring to track multi-agent workflows
- More complex deployment and configuration management

## Implementation Notes
- Use LangGraph's state management for passing context between agents
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for agent fault tolerance
- Add comprehensive logging at agent boundaries for debugging
- Design agents to be stateless for horizontal scalability
