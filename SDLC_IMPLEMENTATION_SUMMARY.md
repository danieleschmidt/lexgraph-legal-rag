## üîß Workflow Configuration

### GitHub Actions Workflows (Manual Setup Required)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: GitHub Actions workflows need to be added manually due to repository permissions.

The following workflow files need to be created in `.github/workflows/`:

1. **ci.yml**: Comprehensive CI with testing, linting, and security
2. **cd.yml**: Automated deployment to staging and production  
3. **security.yml**: Daily security scanning and vulnerability reporting
4. **dependencies.yml**: Automated dependency management and updates
5. **release.yml**: Semantic release management with notifications

**Manual Setup Instructions**: Create the `.github/workflows/` directory and add the workflow files using the GitHub web interface or by pushing them manually with appropriate permissions.

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Black**: Code formatting
- **Ruff**: Fast Python linting
- **detect-secrets**: Secret detection

### Development Commands
```bash
make dev              # Start development server
make test             # Run test suite
make lint             # Code quality checks
make docker-up        # Start with Docker
make ci-test          # Simulate CI locally
```
