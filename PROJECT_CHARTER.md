# LexGraph Legal RAG - Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: LexGraph Legal RAG  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: August 2025  
**Project Lead**: Development Team  

## Problem Statement

Legal professionals and researchers face significant challenges when searching through vast legal document repositories for relevant clauses, precedents, and regulatory information. Traditional keyword-based search systems fail to capture semantic relationships and contextual meaning, leading to incomplete research and missed critical information.

## Solution Description

LexGraph Legal RAG provides an intelligent, multi-agent system that:
- Employs advanced semantic search across legal document corpora
- Uses specialized AI agents for retrieval, summarization, and citation
- Delivers precise, citation-rich responses with source references
- Scales to handle large legal document collections efficiently

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Multi-agent architecture with recursive graph decision-making
- Vector database indexing for legal documents (statutes, SEC filings, contracts, case law)
- Semantic search with legal-domain embeddings
- Real-time query processing with sub-second response times
- Citation-rich response generation with precise clause-level references
- RESTful API with authentication and rate limiting
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability
- Containerized deployment with Kubernetes support

### Out of Scope
- Real-time document updates from external legal databases
- Integration with proprietary legal platforms (Westlaw/LexisNexis) - future enhancement
- Multi-jurisdiction legal framework support - future enhancement
- Legal advice generation or decision recommendations
- Document editing or modification capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Query Response Time**: < 1 second for 95% of queries
2. **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime in production
3. **Document Scaling**: Handle 10,000+ legal documents efficiently
4. **Concurrent Users**: Support 100+ simultaneous users
5. **Citation Accuracy**: 95%+ precision in clause-level citations

### Secondary Success Metrics
1. API adoption and usage growth
2. User satisfaction with response relevance
3. System reliability and error rates
4. Developer productivity improvements
5. Documentation completeness and accessibility
