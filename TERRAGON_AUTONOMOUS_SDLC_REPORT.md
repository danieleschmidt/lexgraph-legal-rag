## Manual Setup Requirements

### Critical Action Required
**GitHub Actions Workflow Activation**: Copy workflow files from `docs/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/` to enable CI/CD automation.

```bash
# Execute this command to activate workflows
mkdir -p .github/workflows
cp docs/workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: activate GitHub Actions workflows from documentation"
```

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks
- **Low Risk**: All enhancements are documentation and configuration-based
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Rollback Strategy**: Git revert capabilities for all changes
- **Testing Required**: Validate workflow activation in staging environment

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Gradual Rollout**: Implement enhancements incrementally
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced observability during implementation
- **Backup Plans**: Complete rollback procedures documented
- **Team Training**: Knowledge transfer for new automation tools
