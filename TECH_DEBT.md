## Outstanding Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **API Module Testing** - 0% coverage on 212 lines in `api.py`
   - Complex dependency injection causing test failures
   - Need to refactor authentication and rate limiting for testability
   
2. **Auth Module Testing** - 0% coverage on 62 lines in `auth.py`
   - Key management and authentication logic needs comprehensive testing
   
3. **Cache Module Testing** - 22% coverage on 144 lines in `cache.py`
   - LRU cache implementation needs edge case testing
   
4. **Versioning Module Testing** - 0% coverage on 130 lines in `versioning.py`
   - API version negotiation middleware needs testing

### Medium Priority
5. **HTTP Client Testing** - 0% coverage on 131 lines in `http_client.py`
   - Network calls and error handling need mocking
   
6. **FAISS Index Testing** - 19% coverage on 143 lines in `faiss_index.py`
   - Vector search operations need test data setup
   
7. **Document Pipeline Testing** - 16% coverage on 130 lines in `document_pipeline.py`
   - Document processing workflows need integration tests

### Architectural Issues
- **Test Environment Setup**: Complex dependency injection makes unit testing difficult
- **Mock Strategy**: Need consistent mocking patterns for external services (FAISS, HTTP)
- **Test Data Management**: Need fixtures for legal documents, embeddings, etc.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Refactor API dependency injection** to support test mode with mocked dependencies
2. **Create test fixtures** for common test data (documents, embeddings, cache states)
3. **Implement test utilities** for mocking external services consistently

### Long-term Strategy
1. **TDD for new features** - All new code should be developed test-first
2. **Gradual legacy coverage** - Target 10-15% coverage increase per iteration
3. **Integration test suite** - End-to-end testing for critical user journeys
4. **Performance benchmarks** - Ensure tests also validate performance requirements
