1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. Install and run `pre-commit` before submitting a PR:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   pre-commit run --all-files
   ```
   This executes `ruff`, `black`, and secret scanning automatically.
3. Ensure new features include tests and documentation.
4. Fill out the PR template describing your changes.
