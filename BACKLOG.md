# Technical Backlog - WSJF Prioritized

## Scoring Methodology
**WSJF Score = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction) / Job Size**
- Business Value: 1-10 (user impact, revenue, competitive advantage)
- Time Criticality: 1-10 (urgency, dependencies)
- Risk Reduction: 1-10 (security, stability, compliance)
- Job Size: 1-13 (effort estimate in story points)
