## Product Review
- The new `API_USAGE_GUIDE.md` documents versioned routes and a default fallback.
- `create_api` in `api.py` supports versioned and unversioned paths.
- Router keyword customization added in `multi_agent.py` for flexibility.
- Acceptance criteria in `tests/sprint_acceptance_criteria.json` are met via dedicated tests for versioning behavior and documentation.

Overall, the feature adds semantic versioning to the API with clear documentation and test coverage.
